It contrasts (A) the political power of heterosexuals and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) members of the polity who are not open about their sexuality with (B) the political power of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) members of the polity who are open about their sexuality. Note that in comparing the political power of these two groups, their power per person is being compared. So, when it is said that LGBT have less, equal, or more power than heterosexuals it means relative to their share of the population (as near as this can be estimated). The indicator is measured on an ordinal scale from 0 to 4.\r\n0: LGBTs are entirely excluded from the public sphere and thus deprived of any real political power (even though they may possess formal powers such as the ballot).\r\n1: LGBTs have much less political power than heterosexuals. LGBTs enjoy formal rights to participate in politics but are subject to informal norms that often serve to exclude them from the halls of power.\r\n2: LGBTs have somewhat less political power than heterosexual citizens.\r\n3: LGBTs have about the same political power as heterosexuals. Each group enjoys a degree of political power that is roughly proportional to their population.\r\n4: LGBTs enjoy somewhat more political power than heterosexuals by virtue of greater wealth, education, and high level of organization and mobilization.\r\n",
